# Hyprland-panel
A very WIP bar written in python for hyprland that uses gtk 3 gtk-layer-shell and hyprctl (a hyprland utility)

## Usage
### Dependency's (these are the package names for arch)
 - python
 - python-gobject
 - gtk-layer-shell

 ## Notes
  - Updating to gtk4 would be nice since gtk-layer-shell has updated but I think that I will wait a little for distro packages to catch up
